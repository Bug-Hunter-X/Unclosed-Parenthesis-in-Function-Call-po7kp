This repository contains a simple Python example demonstrating a common coding error: an unclosed parenthesis in a function call.

The `bug.py` file shows the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.py` file provides the corrected code. This type of error often leads to `SyntaxError` exceptions and can be challenging to diagnose in larger programs.  The example highlights the importance of careful attention to detail when writing code.
